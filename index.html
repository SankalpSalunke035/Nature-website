            <h3>HIBISCUS</h3>
            <p>
                The leaves are often lobed and may be smooth or covered in trichomes (plant hairs). The flowers can be borne singly or in clusters, and the flowers of many species last only a single day. An epicalyx (whorl of leaflike bracts that surrounds the sepals) is particularly common, and the stamens are typically fused into a tube. Members of the genus characteristically have spiny pollen, and their fruits are capsules.
